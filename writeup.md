### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

The code for this step is contained in the first code cell of the IPython notebook located in [Advanced-Lane-Lines.ipynb](Advanced-Lane-Lines.ipynb).

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  

I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:

### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Undistorting
To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:

#### 2. Perspective transformation (birds eye view)

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `warper()`, which appears in lines 1 through 8 in the file `example.py` (output_images/examples/example.py) (or, for example, in the 3rd code cell of the IPython notebook).  The `warper()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:

```python
src = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 2) - 55, img_size[1] / 2 + 100],
    [((img_size[0] / 6) - 10), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 5 / 6) + 60, img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] / 2 + 55), img_size[1] / 2 + 100]])
dst = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 4), 0],
    [(img_size[0] / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), 0]])
```

This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 585, 460      | 320, 0        | 
| 203, 720      | 320, 720      |
| 1127, 720     | 960, 720      |
| 695, 460      | 960, 0        |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

#### 3. Segmentation of lane lines

I used a combination of color thresholds in on channels in different colour spaces to generate a binary images.
In order to find out which colour channel describes the white and yellow lines best I considered the colour channels of the colour spaces RGB, HLS and LAB. I selected some example images, converted them to the mentioned colour spaces and plotted all available colour channels for visualisation purpose.
In the end I chose the L channel of the HLS colour space for detecting white lines and the B channel of the LAB colour space for detecting yellow lines.

Here's an example of my output for this step.

#### 4. Lane detection

##### 1. Initial window search
* Histogram from bottom half of image
* Filtering with median filter
* Peak search
* weighted averaging of peaks to identify left and right starting point for lanes
* Creating windows to mark pixels considered for line fitting

##### 2. Fitting lines with RANSAC approach

##### 3. Averaging line coefficients

##### 4. Plausability testing of line fits
* Check 1: check if lines are somewhat parallel by comparing sign of coefficients, only if all signs of the left and right line fit are identical we assume parallel lines
* Check 2: check if lines are intersecting already within the unwarped image
* Check 3: check if apex point of left and right line fit is within a reasonable range:
Then I did some other stuff and fit my lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial kinda like this:
* Check 4: check if both line fits are the same

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

I did this in lines # through # in my code in `my_other_file.py`

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented this step in lines # through # in my code in `yet_another_file.py` in the function `map_lane()`.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
